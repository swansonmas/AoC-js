# Advent of Code
## Learning JavaScript in December

### General Approach
Since the primary goal is to get an introduction to JavaScript, external libraries are avoided within the solutions. Primary exceptions being [astar.js](https://github.com/bgrins/javascript-astar) and [md5.min.js](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5) which I will conveniently excuse for the sake of Day solution speeds.

Nearly all Days are completed for speed, with many having my best-guess at solution time using either the Advent of Code Stats page or Google's stopwatch.

### Observations
Watching the progression through the overall 'Day#' folder setup in the early Days is where most adjustments are made; a combination of learning more about the language and attempts to streamline input parsing and output displaying is seen in the helper functions, webpage, and input methodologies.

Notepad++ and Chrome side-by-side were used for all Days, but apparently I could have been using Chrome DevTools standalone with its Workspaces.

[Mozilla's MDN JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) has been my best resource and an excellent language reference. Certainly no blame can be placed on a lack of or confusion over documentation!
